    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The best swamp soup is made with beans, greens, tomatoes with green chiles, and savory Southern smoked sausage. It's a hearty soup, and it's delicious with cornbread!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound smoked sausage, such as Conecuh®, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 jalapenos, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>4 medium gold potatoes, diced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can seasoned turnip greens</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can Hoppin' John or seasoned black-eyed peas</li>
        <li>1 (10-ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles</li>
        <li>1 can navy beans, drained</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chicken bouillon paste, such as Better Than Bouillon®, or 2 chicken bouillon cubes</li>
        
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
